# "JavaScript is the only language that people feel they don't need to learn before they start using it." - Brendan Eich

## Context
Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, made this observation about how JavaScript is often treated differently from other programming languages. Many developers dive into JavaScript without proper learning, leading to common pitfalls and anti-patterns.

## Why This Matters

1. **Accessibility**: JavaScript runs in the browser, making it easy to start without setup
2. **Forgiving Nature**: JavaScript's loose typing and automatic type coercion can hide errors
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Browser console allows quick testing without compilation

## The Problem
This approach leads to:
- Misunderstandings of core concepts
- Buggy code
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues

## Better Approach
1. Learn JavaScript fundamentals first
2. Understand prototypal inheritance
3. Study the event loop and asynchronous programming
4. Learn ES6+ features
5. Follow best practices and style guides
